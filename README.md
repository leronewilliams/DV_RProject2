CS329e Data Visualization R Project 2

Hello  Xun,

Here a few reminders to look for as you evaluate this project.
1. The project performs better on Windows at this time.
2. When you first knit the HTML, it will pop up a RGL device 1 [Focus] window and keep working in the background.
3. After a few seconds, the window will disappear and the HTML will appear.
4. Scroll down to see if the spinnable 3d plot is present. If not follow the directions in the document. (Your browser will need to support WebGL.)
5. The 3d spinnable plot and the scatter plot matrix represent the entire data set.
6. I included the 3d spinnable plot at the suggestion of Dr. Cannata.
